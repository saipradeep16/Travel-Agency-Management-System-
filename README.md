## üßæ Conclusion

Through this project, we investigated the complexities involved in managing customer bookings, service coordination, and travel agency logistics. We focused on developing a robust relational database design tailored to modern travel needs and future scalability.

The project demonstrated that a properly structured relational database can efficiently manage key aspects of a travel agency ‚Äî from customers and bookings to services and providers. By implementing SQL queries, we were able to retrieve valuable insights such as booking statuses, payment summaries, and service availability, enabling data-driven decision-making and efficient operations.

The system ensured data accuracy, minimized redundancy, and allowed for advanced query execution through the use of primary and foreign keys. It has the potential to integrate with external systems like airline APIs and be extended with machine learning capabilities to predict customer preferences and demand trends.

Overall, the Travel Agency Management System serves as a scalable and efficient solution for digital transformation in the tourism and travel industry.
